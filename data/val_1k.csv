My dog is an Australian Shepherd, 8 years old and loves her toys!!First, I love that it has the 'hunting' element to it. She will stick her entire nose/face into the holes to get the last squirrel/chipmunk!! It's so cute.When I put all three in she will grab it and shake it violently (as in going in for the kill) and they fling out one at a time!!! Hilarious to watch.Then, I LOVE that the each squeak!!! And so does my dog. She will pounce on them and chew it to hear it squeak!!This has quickly become one of her FAVORITE TOYS, and believe me, she has quite a lot of them. When we tell her to get 'Chippy' (we think they look more like chipmunks) she runs over to the toy and pounces!!!Then, when she is more calm or tired, she will cuddle with them as well.I bought this for her last Christmas (2011) and she plays with it constantly and ROUGH and it is still in GREAT condition!!!Granted, she doesn't chew things apart, so I don't know if your dog is prone to chewing toys apart how that would play out.But I can't believe it looks as good as it does after months and months of playing!!I am SO happy I bought this toy -- as it is more ""interactive"" than most and she loves it!!!

The base unit also plays pleasant classical music and has a nice, warm nightlight (both of which don't seem to do anything for my guy, though). Putting together the mobile wasn't too difficult either, considering that I managed to do it all by myself WHILE carrying my son in a front-load baby carrier.

He loved to play with the one at his grandma's house (an older version purchased at a garage sale a few years back) so I thought I would buy one for our house, too. When I took it out of the box, the silo section was not connected. I connected it without too much trouble but then opened the farm and the silo fell off. It continues to fall off all of the time! I have given up trying to keep the pieces together - it is a waste of my time. The farm animals now share stalls in the barn -making it a bit harder to make the animal sounds. It appears that the toy has been ""remodeled"" to be less expensive to make. The plastic is thinner, the quality poorer, and the spaces/stalls for the animals smaller and more complicated.

I used to tan in tanning beds and outdoors, I loved the color I got but was very worried about sun cancer and aging skin. So I started experimenting with many different sunless tanners, prices ranging from $5 to $60. I was disappointed with most, either they left me looking very orange or yellow and/or very streaky. I finally decided to order the St. Tropez bronzing mousse after hearing great things about it. It really does live up to the hype in my opinion; it dries quickly, gives instant color, and after showering it off the next day it looks very natural. The color didn't turn out as deep as I expected, but it was still a nice golden color and I'm sure with a second application the day after it would turn out even darker, which I have yet to try. The scent is nice, I still get the sunless tan smell the next day but it isn't as bad as some other brands I've tried. It does stain palms, so I use cheap latex gloves to apply the tanner, then use a tiny bit on the tops of my hands.The price is somewhat high, but honestly if the bronzing mousse was $100 I would still buy it so I think it's completely worth every penny. It lasts me a while if I use it 1-2 times a week. I hope they never stop making this product, and I definitely recommend it to anyone wanting natural color.",beauty,bath body,scrubs body treatments

The noise is not blocked as perfectly as with the other one but it is still a huge difference if you learn how much you need to cut.

The 'stiffening' isn't stiff at all, and not only offers ZERO support, but leaves a bulky u-shape that puts pressure on the soft tissue around the ankle. The material is bulky and does not fit into shoes easily or comfortably. It has no stretch around the calf so it bites into the hamstring & achilles tendon. The lacing is difficult to use at best, it has to be completely un-laced and re-laced every time the brace is removed/put on. Also, the lacing is angled such-that it does not tighten at the 'bend' in the front of the ankle, so it does not hold the ankle steady forward/back either.

This scent is built around lavender, iris, and cocoa. The opening drives some people nuts. It starts with very strong iris that is reminiscent of the scent used in makeup and lipstick. Unlike those scents, the iris here is more subtle and it changes rapidly after the initial spray. I rather like the smell, but I can see how it would not appeal to everyone. After the fragrance dries down, it comes into its own. The iris is pushed to the sideline, though it is still noticeable. Taking its place is a clean, rich lavender. While there are many lavender scents on the market, this is a very high quality lavender. But the imaginative part, and really the reason to buy the fragrance, is the pairing of this lavender with cocoa. This gives the lavender a sweetness and a depth that is unusual and excellent. It's not a gourmand fragrance, the cocoa is very much in the background, but it definitely colors the lavender to make for a unique experience.

Not only that, but other hair products make my head itch. When I say itch, I mean itch! I about can't stand my own head it will itch so bad. Even hair products designed to stop itch do not work on my scalp! As a last effort before I went crazy I had bought a set of Organix- the Moroccan Argan Oil. Since this review is just for the conditioner, I'll stick with my thoughts on it.Paired with the shampoo, it really makes such a difference in my hair and scalp! This set has almost completely stopped my itching. Not only that, but my hair is not as oily and it feels very, very soft. This is coming from someone who dyes their hair religiously. I love that when my hair moves, no lie, it almost looks like a TV ad. My hair is so soft, so shiny, and healthy looking.The conditioner isn't a 'to die for' smell, it smells good and that's what counts. It is a product that you have to use a little bit more than you would with other conditioners. Otherwise I feel it doesn't cover my head well enough and I have chin length hair. What you have to remember is that you have to wait 3 to 5 minutes before you wash this conditioner off.

Instead, the current is restricted down to nearly the MED setting.These 1000 mAh batteries will provide full power, and they'll almost double the run-time duration of many bicycle lights. They do self-discharge though, at least more so than the eneloop cells, so if you use something rarely, go with the eneloops.I carry these as my installed batteries, with 2 more carried as spares, and one eneloop cell to make 3.

I used this product morning after my shower after drying my feet well. Then at night, hit or miss, before bedtime as well. It took about 3 weeks of use, but now my heels look fantastic and healthy. All the dryness is gone! The cracks are almost all totally healed as well.I used the Mr Pumice (purple bar) gently under running water with gentle cleanser, then dried my feet well and applied the Dr. Scholls to my heels. Voila!I'll never be without this product again. Give it time.

I liked the fact that it was corn and ""natural"" so the dust that is inhaled by me and the cats isn't full of chemicals. However, my cats' first reaction to this litter was the same as other reviewers - a temptation to eat it. One cat kept trying to chew thru the bag to get to it. Initially, the same cat wouldn't even cover his eliminations - because he didn't like the feel against his feet? It's hard to know. In any case, I did mix the finer Cat's Pride (which seems to be the first choice for the cats) with World's Best and it seems to be doing an adequate job. I don't know what I continue to torture my boys through various cat litters when they are happiest with Cat's Pride but I am still trying to find a ""healthier"" solution. So, I tried Dr. Elsey's Precious and wrote a review of that and that's definitely off the list and I'm not sold on World's Best so I will try SwheatScoop next. I've heard lots of good things about it but will probably always mix it with Cat's Pride. Cat's Pride seems to make my cats the happiest - they like the texture and it has great odor absorbing qualities - and I am reluctant to let them have it because it contains sodium bentonite. In any case, I wouldn't give World's Best 5 stars - I'll go 4 because it clumps well, doesn't seem to smell but the cats don't love it.",pet supplies,cats,food

Currently I am on day 29 0f 40 Day Water Fast!! This is by far the hardest thing that I have ever done in my life!!! The reason I say that is because of the long list of detox symptoms that come along with it, the worst one being absolutely NO ENERGY to do even the simplest tasks. I have done Vitamin C Flushes in the past and decided that this would be a great time to incorporate it into my water detox fast. It worked out perfectly! During the fast I have done a total of 11 days of Vitamin C flushes and have seen MASS amounts of built up mucus and toxins just pour out of my Lymphatic system!!! So often society is guided into thinking that ""changing your diet and exercise"" will net you a healthier life. While that may be ""half"" true, we forget that when we lived a TOXIC LIFESTYLE, that all of the toxins that we have ingested are permanently lodged inside of our tissues. We have to flush these out by some sort of means and it is by my personal experience that I believe that long water fasts and vitamin c flushes are the only way. The first couple of flushes netted me thick pasty like mucus out of the rectum. As I continued the flushes, I noticed less and less mucus that resembled more of a ""shrapnel"" consistency. This product definitely works if you are in the market for purchasing it for the purpose of Vitamin C Flushes. I should have bought a smaller jar as I do not see myself needing the product for the remanding duration of the fast. I would have given it five stars but the only thing I didn't like about it is the unpredictability of passing a mucus flush after it is ingested which can last for up to two days, but all Ascorbic Acid does that.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

This popular oil works against fungus, bacteria, and viruses. It is known to effectively fight a number of infections that are resistant to some antibiotics and is used by eczema and psoriasis sufferers.It is also used literally for hundreds of bacterial and fungal skin ailments such as acne, abscess, oily skin, blisters, sun burns, athlete's foot, warts, herpes, insect bites, rashes, dandruff and other minor wounds and irritations. The anti-viral properties of the oil fight many common infectious diseases such as chicken pox, shingles and measles, flu, cold sores and verrucae while improving the body's immune system.It is no wonder that tea tree oil, despite it's strong unfamiliar odor, is considered an essential oil.My experience with Now Foods Tea Tree Oil (16 ounce) is good. The oil is a high quality and works just as well as the medicinal quality 1 ounce bottles purchased from stores like Walgreens but the savings buying it in a 16 ounce quantity from Now Foods is obvious. The lid could be a bit better in my opinion and like another reviewer pointed out this doesn't come with a dropper. Because of the high quality of the oil, the decent savings, etc...

Since it doesn't say what kind of sugar, we must presume it's white, refined sugar. There may be as much as 530mg of Vit C in each tablet, but apparently only about 30mg of that is from natural sources.

It is not as easy to get into as Dominion because a player needs to be fairly familar with all the cards in the deck so that appropriate stategies and decisions can be made.Play can vary greatly depending on how many people are playing. If 2 people are playing then the Library is a must build if you get it. And then if you get a Quarry... gg. On the other hand, if you can get Library, Smithy, Guild Hall then that is gg. If neither player gets either of those combos then you can have some fun games. With 3 to 4 players, the Library becomes less effective.For the price, I think this is a good game if you like playing games like Dominion, etc. The set up time is about 2 minutes and a 2-player game can be over in about 15-20mins which is a great advantage over games like Puerto Rico and Power Grid if you are short on time.The level of strategy versus luck in this game is definitely tilted in the favor of luck (unlike the above mentioned games). This can be frustrating at times if you are a big strategist but also allows those that are more casual gamers to feel superior to the hardcore gamer that gets some bad draws.All in all, this is a good game with a 3-4 game learning curve (to really know all the cards) but that can be done in less than one hour.",toys games,games,card games

I used the entire package in one treatment and nothing happened. If you have a swimming pool then you know how irritating and expensive it is to constantly treat the horrible brown stains that appear on the underwater surfaces. The only effective thing I have found is a combination of Iron Out and Iron Myte. The trouble is, if you then fail to replace the water, or at least half of it, with iron-free water, the stains come right back within 24 hours. Although effective, each treatment with those products was costing me $30 each time, essentially every other day, until I was able to obtain iron-free water to drain and refill the pool. By the way, Iron Myte is much cheaper at Menards compared to Am......on. About 1/2 the price regularily. Also, I know that Iron Out is not recommended for swimming pools because it's an irritant.

I live in Las Vegas and have used the Moby in the summer without either of us overheating. When my boys got a bit older (6-9 months), I loved using the Hip position. Much easier than just holding them on your hip. I admit that I have yet to test the 35lb limit of the wrap as my boys started walking before they were that big. I can see that it is a bit cumbersome to put on in public. I have found that the way the Moby wraps around you almost looks like a shirt and if I am at a restaurant or somewhere sitting down, I can take the baby out but keep the wrap on. Then I can just put my baby back in the wrap when I need to, no need to re-wrap. I don't usually wear it in a situation where I am taking it on and off again.

Well I had to taste one to see what she was talking about and yes I must say it is very good...IF I didn't know any better I would have thought it was candy. The directions state to take one wafer 3 times per day but I only give her 1 tablet every morning with her vitamin. (They call it a wafer but it is a tablet..think something like a tums antacid in size)She has taken this tablet and missed her daily dose of Miralax and was able to go to the bathroom without any issues...will have to see about skipping 2 days to see if the tablet alone is effective.

The ingredients in Almased are basic which is what I like. The texture is a little coarser than other shakes I have tried, but this one keeps me satisfied much longer without making my blood sugar go through the roof. In my opinion I think the trade off is fair. I do dress it up a little though. I either add stevia and a table spoon of regular unsweetened cocoa powder, or sugar free hazelnut espresso syrup with a table spoon of dark unsweetened cocoa powder. Without any dressing up, the taste and texture remind me of a cross between muffin batter and cake batter. There are no artificial flavors but it has a creamy flavor, probably from the honey. I prefer to mix it with ice in the blender. If you make it with coffee and chocolate for a mocha flavor the coffee has to be at least room temperature or colder to avoid killing the probiotics. There are a few other recipes I want to try as well, just haven't gotten around to it yet.I haven't used it long term for weight loss, but have used it to recover from overdone splurges or when I'm just looking for a very light meal. If I splurge and put on a couple pounds I can usually recover and lose them again after doing my shakes for a couple days.Pros:Basic ingredientsLow glycemic impactSatisfying and stays with youGreat for getting in extra protein or for managing weightCons:The texture is a little coarser than most other shakes, but that is because it is minimally processed (in comparison to other mixes)The price is a bit high but this seller is lower than what I can get it locally forShipping was fast and arrived just as promised.

The first time it happened, I was ready to go to the emergency room. The second time was worse, but I figured out what it was and thought that I could get through one more round without ER treatment; and I did. It feels like your blood veins are on fire and it goes all over your body and then you itch. It lasts quite a while. For me, the second time, it was about an hour for the fire/itch part in full force, then another hour of getting better gradually.

I was looking for relief in any form and came across this stretching system on Amazon with good reviews. I have been using this for only a few days and have already felt relief in my achilles tendon's just from using this to stretch them a couple times throughout the day. It provides a better stretch than using a wall or staircase to stretch. All you do is position your foot in it while near a wall, using the wall to balance yourself and letting your other leg just dangle. You rock backward and you will immediately feel a stretching feeling from the back of your heel all the way up to the top of your calf muscle. You hold that for about 30 seconds than you can switch to the other foot or do again if you feel the need to stretch more. I didn't even realize how tight my calf muscles were until I used this and I will continue to use this in the future to prevent injury and prior to running.The only other recommendation and note I have is that you definitely want to have a sneaker or some sort of foot protection on when using this and not just go barefoot or with a sock. The surface and heel cup are very hard and it doesnt feel great on your foot if you don't have a shoe on, hence the 4 stars rather than 5.

This spray should be used if you see one or two fleas and are doing the regular flea maintenance (drops, etc) on your pet. Fleas are very resistant to everything and very bad in the fall.

I was a little skeptical though. When I got the product, it looked pretty legit and I had some left over from an original I had bought at the MAC store to compare. The one I purchased here was just a little yellower than the original one I had but did not think anything of it as mine was a little over a month old. Immediately with the first try, I knew this product was not the same. I have been using this compact for over 6 years and have NEVER had an issue with it until I bought it here. No matter how hard I tried to get the powder on the sponge, it would not absorb onto the sponge the same way. Eventually, these hard, dark bumpy areas formed on the powder so I avoided that area of the compact because it would not budge on to the sponge at all. I did a half and half face comparison with my leftover MAC and the this one and all my blemishes and dark spots were still visible on the ""fake MAC"" side. The original side, flawless and perfect. I was really disappointed but should have known better when trying to score a deal. Maybe I got an old expired one, I don't know. I threw it out after my experiment from disgust.

388,B00016KMIS,Sunbeam/Oster 1500 watt wall mounted hair dryer.,A27C0WINTZBRL3,0/0,5.0,1345507200,I bought 3 Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since. After a few years' use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.I'm impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it's just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I'm happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years.,beauty,hair care,styling tools

The price is really high for a finished parawood (rubber tree) product, which is a relatively inexpensive wood. Being that these are parawood, which is one of the world's densest woods, the blocks are very heavy. In one way, it is good because they stay put.

This smell is very bad and I thought maybe my bottle of Fake Bake was old or spoiled. But it has not expired.I also found Fake Bake washed off. It didn't seem to last but a day or two. I exfoliated, moisturized knees, elbows, etc. and used the gloves (which ripped quickly), but did not get a lasting tan.

I can't really comment on this yet, but plan to toss the cover in the wash once a week, let it air dry and alternate covers. It doesn't seem like it'll be too complicated to swap out. One small irritation is that the fabric is described as ""leatherette"" and I was expecting more of a vinyl feel.

I keep two of these pads out for her during the day while I am at work and uses one pad for wee's and another pad for poo's. My only recommendation would be to consider ordering a smaller size if you want to replace the pads after each use and don't want to have used pads on the floor for a couple of days in a row.

I find that, as with all massagers of any type, it feels bestest when you aren't actively holding it, something about having to direct the energy yourself makes it less satisfying... so rubber-band the thing onto your back like a backpack, or onto your calf or whereaver, and it feels so much better... hands free yo, hands free.Also having something secured to the head makes it way quieter.Buy 7 of them and give them out as gifts. do it.",health personal care,health care,massage relaxation

My daughter went to the salon and said the hairdresser told her the same thing. Her hair was falling out in clumps in the shower too.

Now, they are 17 months and 3yrs old and approximately 60lbs combined. Sometimes our eldest doesn't want to walk but pushing that kind of weight is impossible. The wheels aren't responsive and coupled with the weight of the stroller (~35lbs) it is quite a load to push around parks/playgrounds/cities. The manufacturer suggests up to 45lbs but that is not very long depending on the age and size of your kids. Ours are both tall for their age but normal weight.It was great when we had a newborn but the infant seat does push back the backrest so that if your other child is sitting, they may bump their head on it. It's not ideal but for us, it did the trick until now.

She's fine on a regular collar until she sees a squirrel or a bunny. While we work on this issue, I need a way to control her so she doesn't choke herself. The GL works great, but she stops periodically on the walk to try to scratch it off her face. I feel bad that she's uncomfortable and worry that she's going to scratch herself, so I've been looking for alternatives. Now I remember why I gave up on these harnesses with my other dogs. They don't fit every dog, and even when they do fit, they chafe under the arms unless your dog has a really thick coat. My pittie mix immediately tried to rub this off her and I could see why - the buckles were pressing right into her armpits no matter how I adjusted the straps.It's going back without even a walk. It looks less comfortable and more harmful than the GL. I may try the Freedom Harness with the velvet straps next, or she'll just have to get used to the GL.This harness might work if your dog is perfectly proportioned for it, but it didn't work for my pretty normally proportioned dog.",pet supplies,dogs,collars

I fixed my hair (sort of) after several processes of stripping it & re-coloring it over the past 3 months. I also had to chop off 3 inches because of this dye & how it left my hair. I ended up ""fixing"" it by stripping it with Kenra lightener & then re-coloring with a few John Frieda foams. I'm still not out of the woods. I'll have to keep cutting my hair as it grows out because it's been damaged so badly by this dye. It will be years before my hair is back to an acceptable state. I hate this dye!!! Never again!Thankfully, the John Frieda dye has restored some of the texture back into my hair & returned it to a healthier condition. My hair felt better even after bleaching than after this dye.

A traditional hamper takes up valuable floor space and so I asked my husband to see what he could find. We found this bag and it looked like just what we needed.

The first time I washed it I found it slides easily off the frame and though I was expecting to feeland see a difference in the canvas after a washing, I was pleasantly surprised to find I could not even tell it hadbeen through the wash!- The size is spot on. This hamper easily holds a weeks worth of laundry for my two active, messy little boys. But it isnot so big that it gets in the way or looks gaudy.- It carries easily. Even though the hook moves around, when you pick it up by the hook, the hook slides intothe locked position and the frame remains stable and it is not awkward or hard to carry around.Cons- If you are hanging the hook on a bar or rail there is the possibility that it can slide up and down.FYI",health personal care,household supplies,laundry

I use the conditioner daily and I feel that it has helped not only with strenth of my hair but also adds to the control I am actually using less product now in my hair because my hair will stay put and I am no longer trying to keep it tame on windy days. Not really any drawbacks on either right now and if you are thining a little or want to boost your hairs strength I would say give it shot.

Much easier to pop off the top, scoop and then return the top to the litter box without latching the side tabs. The top sits fine on the bottom without the snap latches and do not fall off when a cat enters or exits the box. This litter box works well with kittens and with adults up to about 15 pounds.

They still stink like hell, but they effectively remove all unwanted hair, and leave skin smooth and soft for about 2 weeks. They come with a sponge to smooth the cream on. I leave it on for the shortest duration noted in the instructions, and then rinse off with a gentle Buff Puff Sponge thoroughly in the shower. Hope this helps some of you. If you're skin is highly sensitive, you may want to avoid the Buff Puff method, or avoid cream depilatories completely.

520,B000UYC9SW,Baby K'tan Baby Carrier,ATU54FU1VI1SG,3/3,5.0,1345939200,"I'm on baby #2 and bought this sling the very day she was born. I must say I love this product and use it multiple times a day. As a mother of an active 2 year old, I have to always have my hands free. I also have the Moby Wrap and Baby Bjorn from my first, but so far, I prefer the Baby Ktan.Pros:1) SO easy to put on. Put it around your neck while holding baby. With one arm holding baby, slip one arm through a loop, move the baby to that arm, slip the opposite arm in the other loop. The Ktan NEVER touches the ground and your baby is always in your arms to avert the hold-me-cries which is the reason you need the sling in the first place. The Moby wrap is SO cumbersome to put on, it's not worth it to take out of the house. You definitely need two hands to tie the darn thing in place and the vast length of material inevitably touches the ground, which can be gross if you are at a restaurant or public place. Baby Bjorn is easier to put on than the Moby, but still more difficult than the Ktan. Since there are buckles, usually someone else has to be holding baby to put on.2) Relatively easy to get baby in. This takes some practice. The Ktan and Moby are similar in this regard, but I don't use the extra midsection piece for security since I'm not doing major lifting. I find that if you spread the fabric of each loop out to cover the baby twice, the extra midsection piece is not necessary. Right now my daughter is only 7 weeks old and I pretty much use the Ktan to get her off to sleep or go for walks. If I ever attempt to do more strenuous activity (housecleaning, tackle football), then I'll definitely consider taking the time to place the extra piece.3) Easy to get baby out without waking her. Since I don't use the midsection piece, I simply peel each loop off her back and butt, lean over the crib, and slide her onto the bed. I find that the lifting motion required to get baby out of the Baby Bjorn usually wakes them up.4) Easy to wear when not in use. I don't find the sling particularly fashionable, but if you are in a situation requiring baby to go in and out frequently, it's nice that it is lightweight and stays out of your way so you can drive and walk with ease. I've never left the Baby Bjorn on sans baby, but I imagine its stiffness does not lend to convenient driving.5) Easy to pack. The Moby is huge and difficult to pack, as is the Baby Bjorn. I can throw my Baby Ktan in my diaper bag or purse and have room for other items.6) Saves me the hassle of getting a double stroller - so far. I just pop my toddler in his single stroller like I normally would, throw the little one in the sling and get going. I know this is short-lived while she is still so tiny.Cons:1) The small ring that holds the loops together serves to tighten the wrap once baby is in place. This can be difficult to reach if too high up. Putting on the sling so this ring is within reach takes a little practice, unless you are a body contortionist.2) One size does not fit all. I'm 5'3"" and 140lb (hopefully 15 pounds lighter in the near future!) and wear the size small. My husband is 6'3"" and probably would not be able to fit the sling. This does not pose a problem for us as he would ""never be caught dead wearing a baby in a sling."" But definitely a consideration if your husband would.3) Price. At $10 more than the Moby Wrap, I had to seriously consider whether buying this sling was necessary when I already had the Moby. It's just a few pieces of fabric! Why so expensive? But since I figured I would never have the time to tie the Moby wrap while chasing around my 2 year old, it was worth the money.4) Nursing baby in sling is difficult for me. So far, I haven't had much luck using this to nurse. Maybe it's because I'm on #2 and have much fewer qualms about just whipping it out in public.So after 7 weeks, I'm still loving this product better than the Moby and Bjorn. We'll see if it stands the test of time.",baby products,gear,backpacks carriers

The primary issue is that the clock hands are incorrectly lined up with the numerals on the face, and it doesn't seem to be something that can be adjusted. The result is that it's pretty tough to tell which hour is actually the correct hour (is it 5:30 or 6:30??). It's not usually a real problem, as we are generally aware of what hour we're within, and the minutes don't have to be that precise (it's not like we're running a railroad; it's a baby's room!). Cosmetically, the clock is okay from a few feet away, but upon close examination there is glue smeared across the face in a couple of places which was kind of irritating.

Without question it discourages pulling on the leash, and definitely made walks much easier in all 3 cases. Controlling a dog is definitely easier with the Gentle Leader, and it is very easy to slip on once you get the hang of it.We worked with a very good trainer for 2 of the 3 dogs, and each dog was desensitized to the Gentle Leader by trainer.However there were issues with all 3 dogs -1) Each dog commonly will stop its walk and try to ""paw"" the gentle leader off of its nose. This happens on average once per walk, and no amount of correction seems to stop future ""protests."" Indeed I do not believe the dogs enjoy wearing them.2) The piece which attaches to the leash hangs down so that a dog can chew on it. I have one lab mix which becomes aggressive when he sees another dog or cat while on a walk (and yes we are working on this issue). The lab mix turns his aggression on the Gentle Leader and chews on it HARD. We had a close call recently where he literally chewed all the way through the connection while we were walking him. Luckily I caught on quicker than he did, and was able to attach the leash conventionally to his collar before he bolted after a neighbor's cat.3) Our smallest dog is a 16 lb Chiweenie. He seems to shut down with the Gentle Leader and is more likely to cease walking altogether when wearing it, than he would be otherwise.At this point, we feel like the Gentle Leader helped us with our dogs' walks but also may have provoked some unwanted aggression and protest.

Powerful motor mows down the short hairs with ease2. The design looks good and it feels good in your hand3. Price4. Comes with some accessories should you decide to use this on your face5. Battery operated as opposed to plug and chargeCons:1. EXTREMELY NOISY - If you are in the shower with this thing, people will know what you are doing in there. It is much noisier than the last few models I have used.2. Looks kinda cheap to me but then again most of them at this price point do.3. Very easy to clip some sensitive skin down in that area if you are not careful as the blade moves very fast. I nicked myself twice and drew blood. ...Not painful but annoying.4. I don't think it's waterproof so be careful if you plan on rinsing it. I just do a quick rinse to the tip and clean it with alcohol.For what I use it for, I think it's good for the price and does the job very well.

I was very skeptical even after reading the great reviews but decided to make one more 'last hope' food purchase for my sickly Blue Ram. While all the other fish in the tank were thriving, he was very thin and progressively had gotten worse over the last few months, showing no interest in any food I bought. I tried to find the old 'Parasite Guard' food as a last effort to save my fish. I stumbled over this and thought I'd give it a shot. He showed little interest for a couple of days but then began to nibble it. I have only been using this for a few weeks and my fish looks and feels 100% better. He devours this food! His colors are coming out and he doesn't have that thin appearance now. He is gaining weight and becoming feisty. The other fish love this food as well, even the algae eater looks for every crumb hours after feeding time. Will definitely order again, but will be a while as you don't have to use much.

I tried playing Twister alone one time and I felt like I was defeating the purpose because nobody was standing to the side to watch me hurt myself and stumble around with neverending silent facial giggles. I always feel like somebody's watching me! Truly not one of the more appropriate and proud moments of my life right there, haha. I'm referring to the embarrassment of playing alone to my old Black Sabbath albums. I'm not proud of that at all. I could care less how ridiculous my twisty, turny, awkward body movements are to the always-ready-to-humilate eyeballs watching over me!Anyway, Twister is a game for the entire family. It's sort of like an exercise routine when you really get into it. Maybe even yoga? Nah, not yoga. Entertaining in one square-shaped area on the floor that's safe and well... no, it's not really safe at all. I mean it is safe unless, like I say above, you really get into it. In that case be careful not to fall all over the place and bang your knees on the hard living room floorboards which can bruise with age and cause walking discomfort. When you walk funny you don't want people to know you were twisting the night away the night before. I do wonder if people have actual memories of playing Twister.

658,B0009YJ4CW,Everlasting Treat Ball,A19P2E4G7828KO,2/2,5.0,1346544000,"I originally bought this product to use with the Everlasting treats. My powerful American Bulldog/pit mix popped the Everlasting treats out and consumed them in no time, so I originally chalked this toy up as a failure. But then I realized I could put regular treats inside it, and, used in that manner, it excels.I've gone through several different treat-dispensing toys, trying to find one that both held up to my tough dogs' determined chewing, and also delivered the treats at just the right ""not-too-fast, not-too-slow"" rate. Most of the toys I've tried deliver the treats too quickly, which defeats the purpose of keeping a 'home alone' dog occupied for hours. The Buster Cube delivers treats at a nice rate, but the hard plastic construction makes it so incredibly loud that the noise not only makes it less enjoyable for the dog that's using it, but it also agitates my other dogs that have to listen to it. This toy is very quiet, and VERY durable. My dog is a powerful, determined chewer (he once ate a hard plastic floor tray designed to set dog bowls on)and he has been using this toy daily for months, and it shows very little wear. I fill it about 1/3 full with the low calorie Trader Joe's dog treats, and it keeps my boy happy and focused for hours.So, if your dog is a determined chewer, skip the Everlasting treats and just buy the ball and use it for your own treats. I guess the only challenge might be finding treats that are just the right size, if you don't have access to the Trader Joe's treats, but I'm sure Petsmart and Petco carry something that will work. A treat that is about dime-sized works great. Something the size of dog food kibble would fall out too quickly, but it could be used to deliver a meal to a dog that tends to eat too fast.It might not be apparent from the photo, but the x-shaped treat-dispensing slots are inset from the outer edge of the ball quite a bit, making it very difficult for the dog to chew on that portion of the ball directly, which, along with the material the ball is made of, contributes a lot to its durability.Here's a link to the treats I use in this ball:Trader Joe's Charlee Bear Treatswww.amazon.com/Charlee-Bear-Treat-16-Ounce-Liver/dp/B0002XAFTG/ref=sr_1_cc_1",pet supplies,dogs,treats

At first I used the hair coloring but it was messy and I wasted a whole bottle just trying to fix sideburns and hair at the temple. Also, if you only have graying in a few spots, the hair coloring will make the rest of your hair darker which really doesn't fix anything and makes it noticable. I found that the beard coloring works perfect on head hair also and it is much easier to target only the areas you need to fix. You can also get multiple applications out of a kit. Just make sure to squeeze all the air out of the tubes before putting the caps on or it can degrade.Now, 5 years later, that my gray extends over the ears also, I still use the beard coloring. Once you brush it on, it works best if you take the brush and pull some of the coloring out onto the head to blend it together. If you experiment with the time left in hair by starting at 5 minutes and working up in 1/2 minute increments, you will eventually find where the color is correct. That combined with the blending will make this product work very well. BTW- 5 minutes doesn't hardly change the hair but for me but 6 - 7 minutes works.

So when you eat it causes a horrid cramping pain under your right ribs) I stopped eatting...anything. Which is pretty bad too. Then I started trying different bars and found that many cause my Fatty liver to hurt bad until I ran onto these. Many of the bars are based in chocolate which is not my go to food even before I was diagnosed. So I am always looking for tasty bars OTHER then chocolate.The Orange Smoothie Nugo bar and the Vannilla Yogurt Nugo bars fit that bill well. The round rice things are softer and smaller then most bars which is better for me. They have a light sweet flavor that is very tasty and not alot of sugar substitutes/fat(which a low functioning liver can NOT process well). I think they are marketed to diabetics and I would totally reccomend them to anyone with that condition as well.I wish they sold them more locally and maybe at a better price but hey you can't have everything!!It is good with coffe in the morning(VERY hard for me to eat in the am but have to if I want to keep my blood sugar balance and metabilizum going all day) I add a piece of fruit or as a snack with water....or to replace a weak moment where you'd break out the candy bars...you just break out the orange smoothie bar!!So if you are looking for a tasty nutritonal bar that is fruity vs chocolaty then this IS the bar to buy!!I thank you for reading and I hope you have a happy healthy day:)",grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars

I have had other Bob's Red Mill products, I particularly love the scones, and I've had some different things my sister made. I saw these brownies on sale so I decided to give them a try.I made them exactly as the package instructed and also added the chocolate chips and walnuts (we always have some kind of nuts in our brownies, I was glad when the package suggested it). The batter was really thick compared to a traditional brownie mix. I was hoping it would flatten out a bit during the cooking process, but it retained the weird appearance. I let them cool for a bit and when I cut into them I was surprised at how easy they were to cut, unlike normal brownies which kind of require a special technique so they don't get stuck all over and stuff, I was able to just slice the knife right through these.They actually smell really good, and visually they look nice and normal on the inside. I found the taste to be very bland however. When I bit into a chocolate chip, it was fine, but the plain batter is a bit too cakey and dry and not very flavorful. For me, they had a pretty distinct aftertaste, kind of buttery? I saw someone mention adding a bit of brown sugar.. maybe that would help, or perhaps instead of mixing chocolate chips throughout, I could layer flat chocolate pieces in the middle of the brownie mix. I've seen that done on traditional brownies and it was quite tasty.I don't know.. they weren't terrible by any means but as a non-gluten intolerant person who enjoys other Bob's Red Mill products I wasn't floored by them.",grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies

Like a lot of others, the 10th doctor is my favorite and I really wanted a sonic screwdriver of my own, so when I saw this one I just couldn't pass it up.The toy is plastic, but despite that is an almost exact replica of the one used in the show. It is sturdy for the most part. The sound and light is great.I only have two small complaints. The first is that the pen nubs very easily come off. I put it in my pocket or my bag, and next time I go to pull it out, the pen part has come off. The same goes for the switch that extends the top part out. It is made to take off so you can reach the screw underneath in order to take it apart and put the batters in, it just snaps on and off, but I find it comes off pretty easily.Secondly is that it is plastic. For the price, I feel that at least the silver parts should have been metal. One of the iconic sounds aside from the buzzing that comes with the light is the little metal clinks every time the doctor extends it or flips it or stows it back in his pocket, and so I tend to find the plastic kind of lacking. Unfortunately, metal replicas are extremely expensive.Now, if the price were a bit less, $10 or $15 instead of over $20 then the plastic wouldn't bother me so much. Not counting that, it is still an excellent toy, well made, and looks great. (Though I think it might be a bit bigger than the one in the show). I don't regret buying it, and would recommend it to any fans of the show. But if you're a collector and really want an impressive replica, I'd consider some of the more expensive ones (not found on amazon unfortunately.)",toys games,action toy figures,accessories

It's solidly constructed from genuine cheap plastic parts (excluding the necessary metal for the battery pack) After opening the package the slide button immediately popped off. This is supposed to come loose to allow access to the screw that opens the battery case. However it is always loose and ready to pop off. Lifting my thumb off the button is often enough to pull it loose.The 'two distinct sounds' are barely discernible from each other even in a completely silent room. Press button once for sound one and again for a minutely different sound.The little UV light works perfectly.My sonic arrived with one working pen nib (the ink pen) and one dry pen nib (the UV pen) I can only assume this toy has been sitting in a warm place for a very long time because the UV pen nib was sealed in factory shrink wrap but was still bone dry when it arrived.The suggested 'fix' for this is either add water to the nib. (we all know how well that works) or buy a new one. (oh, I see)The batteries are easily installed but you will need a very small screwdriver to do so. (an actual screwdriver) Which is kind of funny when you think about it.This toy is cute, it's fun to have, but I wouldn't purchase this for anyone under the age of 13. It's simply too delicate to survive any serious 'play'. It's a little overpriced for a novelty pen even if it is in the shape of a sonic.",toys games,action toy figures,accessories

She's also sensitve on her body, so she doesn't like to be massaged with the fairly hard rubbery teeth, and she loves gentle brushing with the black bristles on the sides of her face - she loves it so much that she jumps up into the brushing...The bristles don't feel sticky to me (some reviewer said they attract the hair to it), and I don't find it easier to clean than the first brush I got; nor does it work as well in removing loose hair. Regarding cleaning, I prefer the Safari self-cleaning slicker brush which cleans itself beautifully with the press of a button - all the hair comes off in one neat rectangle; it also removes more loose hair, and I like the color of green Safari brush and the gripper handle.

I have used a lot of this Vitol product, the NOW product and the Optimum Nutrition product. All are roughly comparable in price, with the vanilla Now being 8% more at this time and the Optimum Nutrition chocolate costing 42% more (using the best deals on Amazon now).Optimum Nutrition one of the best tasting and easiest mixing. It also has a nice fluffy consistency that blends easily without caking up on the sides of the blender like some brands. It has some ingredients some may object to- artificial flavors and sweeteners. It has the best looking jar.Between the pure protein NOW powder and the vanilla Vitol, the Vitol is a bit less expensive in the 40oz size but more appealing, better tasting, and mixes up a little better. The Vitol is flavored and sweetened naturally with stevia.I use 100% egg powder because it is cholesterol free, amino-acid balanced and milk-free. Balanced vegan protein powders can be expensive and soy or pea products can be hard to digest; soy also has negative nutritional factors and female hormone analogs. Milk-based powders can have lactose or allergens for some people.So for me egg protein powder is a great way to get protein that is easy to digest, allergen free, inexpensive and low calorie (free of fats and carbs).NOW Foods Eggwhite Protein, 1.2 PoundOptimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound",health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks

Putting packing tape over the cylinder might be a good way to preserve them, but I haven't tried it.-Fairly high capacity.-The tapered tips lets you tailor them to a certain use.The bad:-Although they started out smooth, that didn't last long.

I will have to update this review at a later date once I've tried the machine with gel (I've only used lather), but it seems to work fairly well. Is the lather going to burn your skin coming out? Definitely not. But it's not cold either. It works and is decently heated. I also think the lather comes out less messy than previous (and more expensive) machines I've owned. It has automatic turnoff if you forget to hit the off button. It is a little tricky attaching the bottle to the cap of the machine, but once you correctly get it on, it works well.There is one drawback- you can't shake the can of shaving cream easily while it is in the machine. Thus, your lather comes out someone wet, rather than creamy.

I've read tons of blogs, and the Kong site itself, on how to stuff a Kong and what to stuff it with. I find variety is the best, so while I use the same base ingredients, I toss in something special each time. I currently have 4 Kongs that I rotate between the dog, the dishwasher, and the freezer. I plug the hole in the bottom with a baby carrot, layer in kibble, unsweetened applesauce, shredded meat or canned food, plain Greek yogurt, chopped veggies or fruit, peanut butter or almond butter, broken treats-- whatever I have on hand, then into the freezer it goes. I try to make the first layer he gets something motivating, like applesauce or peanut butter, and the bottom layer something easy, like kibble. The deepest layer is hardest to get to, and the hardest to clean, so I want to be sure he can get it out.

The plant itself is little more than a single twig bent at an angle and really does not resemble a miniature tree unless you apply a lot of imagination. Judging by the pictures, I gather you may luck out and get a nice looking one so before you order, you have to ask yourself, are you feeling lucky? One other thing, the little ""pond"" does not hold water. There were no instructions on caring for it but my daughter gave me some tips. I mist it several times a day and it seems to be healthy enough, just not that much to look at relative to what I hoped it would be.",grocery gourmet food,fresh flowers live indoor plants,live indoor plants

All work well and we are pleased with the cleaning they do. I did need to modify the fill tube attachment on each one. On the 50 year old Eljer toilets there is no center fill tube. The fill tube is molded into the back of the tank. I made a mistake I made years ago. I left the tube full length and it slowly siphoned the water out acting just like a leak. After spending a couple of frustrating days and various replacements for the flush system I realized that there was no leak but rather a siphon. I even remembered that all this happened once before. I cut the tube length so that it was above the water level. Everything has worked fine since. On the one new toilet the fill tube on the Fuidmaster dual flush replacement I installed did not allow for the supplied attachment system to connect to the shouldered tube. It was easy enough to buy a brass tube and solder on a modified brass bar from the discarded flush handle thereby making an idea attachment system. My only concern is that the cast iron hub sewer pipe will eventually be negatively affected by the continual exposure to the strong oxidizing of the chlorine treatment.,health personal care,household supplies,household cleaning

I lost 2 dogs, 1 cat, and my best friend/roommate to cancer all within 2 years.My doctor placed me on Welbutrin but that stuff made me completely insane! 1 day I was angry, 1 day I was completely miserable, 1 day I was unbearably tired. I also had a horrible headache when I was taking it. I felt like was a mindless zombie on Welbutrin. I decided to stop taking the Welbutrin before it settled into my system.I figured I would try and go the more natural route after reading all the side effects of the other anti-depressant medications they have available. I first triedKira St Johns Wort Tablets - 45 Tablets. These seemed to help, but it was very mild and not consistent in keeping my mood up.Then...there was Nature Made Sam-E. I tried some of the store brand Sam-E's to try and keep costs down, however, none of the other brands even came close to working as good as Nature's Made. And if you shop around you can usually find a buy one get one free at Walgreens, Giant, CVS, or even Amazon!This stuff helped me through the roughest time of my life. I've been using Sam-e well over 2 years now and if I even missed one dose I would immediately notice a huge change in my mood. I have been taking 1 400mg pill a day since I started. Once in a while I would take took 2 or 3 in a day.I just started taking 1 pill every other day to give my body a break because I do not like to be dependent on any type of medication. But for those super hard times, this stuff really helped to get me through.I highly recommend trying Sam-E. Especially before trying any prescription anti-depressants. It is a natural approach to overcoming depression, has low to no side effects at all (I never experienced any), and even if it does not help with improving your mental health, at least it is supporting your joints. ;)Hope this helps!",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

They would last for anywhere between 3 days and 10 days.I took over-the-counter pills (AZO, Cystex) and all they did was provide temporary relief. Eventually they stopped being effective altogether since I had to use them about 2 weeks in a row at a time.I got a prescription for Macrobid, an antibiotic. It did work after about a day in clearing up a UTI, but did not prevent them. Plus who would want to be on antibiotics their entire romantic lifetime? Not healthy at all. Expensive too.I ordered this after finding a forum post about it. I didn't believe it would work, I really didn't.... IT DOES. IT WORKS. My marriage is currently long-distance while my husband's immigration from USA to Canada is processing, so I had about a week to start taking one heaping tablespoon a day in a bottle of water. Usually I took it at night, not in the morning (so I'd never forget to if I was in a hurry one morning). My husband arrived to visit me... NO UTIs. NONE.There was one day I did not get to take the powder, and I felt a tiny, tiny little tinge of one coming on (so I took a Macrobid pill as a precaution, even though I probably didn't need to). But the next day I took the powder and never felt discomfort again. So for me, it's 100% proven. THIS WORKS. If you take it daily, you will not have UTIs again.I would also avoid alcohol/fizzy drinks to be honest, anything rough on the bladder. I DID however drink lots of coffee and it didn't affect the powder's usefulness. Still worked!!!I will take this powder every single day for the rest of my life now!!!

He carries it from one place to another, climbs all over it, etc.Batteries seem to last a long time. It runs on D batteries, rather than AC. I have rechargeable D batteries, and I've only had to recharge them a few times. He doesn't play with it every day, but he does play with it a few times a week, sometimes for an hour or two at a time. Alternatively, you can get AA to D battery adapters (I have ones from Focalprice - super cheap, but work marvelously. They convert 2 AA batteries to a D - search ""2AA to D Battery Adapter Converts 2 pieces of AA battery to D battery"" on focalprice dot com). 2 AA batteries are equivalent to 1/2 D, so the batteries will run out faster, but rechargeable AA batteries are cheap and easy to get a hold of, unlike rechargeable D batteries, which are expensive.My son enjoys playing it. It's easy for him to use the controls and do what he wants to do. As he happens to like the ""racing"" games best, he ends up pedaling a lot, though the pedals have very little resistance, and the resistance is not adjustable, so I'm not sure how much exercise he's really getting even when he's pedaling a lot.The seat is adjustable, so it works for kids of various sizes.The games aren't particularly obnoxious.It comes with a very long cord to connect to the TV.It's very easy to set up and use - nothing complicated about it.The cons:It runs on D batteries with no AC option. Yes, if you know what you are doing, you can wire it to run on AC, but most people don't know how to do that. I get that it's nice to not have that extra cord, but you already have a really long cord going to the TV anyway, so why not have the option to run on batteries or AC?The games are pretty much all the same with different characters. We have the game that comes with it, Scooby Doo, Superfriends, and Cars. They look different, but they're all the same game.I don't know how it is with the newer version of this bike, but the games we have with our bike all have graphics that look straight out of the 80s. Cartridges are probably going to hold up better than whatever alternative there could be while still allowing for small kids to handle the media, but would it have really added much to the price of the bike or the cartridges to have the graphics meet Nintendo 64 levels? The bike is already the price of a cheap console, and the games are ridiculously expensive, so I assume the margins are pretty sweet for Fisher Price.There's no memory or saving of anything. You can't take a screen shot and send it anywhere. My son doesn't seem to care or notice, but it would be nice if there was some way to save preferences or save files to a memory card.Overall, none of the cons outweigh the simple fact that my son enjoys this toy, and it has some educational value, and it's not obnoxious.",toys games,dolls accessories,dolls
